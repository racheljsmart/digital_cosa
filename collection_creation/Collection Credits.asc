<h1>Collection Credits</h1>
<p>The work that goes into providing access to digital materials in DigiNole is complex. It requires many hands to complete projects that contribute objects to this digital collection.</p>
<p>The Digital Cosa collection is the result of a digital scholarship collaboration between Cosa Excavations and Matthew Hunter, the Digital Technologies Librarian. The purpose of this collection is to share findings and data of the Cosa archeological dig with the research community. Below are the faculty, staff and students who worked to bring these materials from this collection to our patrons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Sponsor: Matthew Hunter</li>
<li>Project Manager: Matthew Hunter</li>
<li>Digital Object Management and Quality Control: Grace Robbins, Allison Smith, and Rachel Smart</li>
<li>Metadata Creation: Rachel Smart</li>
</ul>
<p>These credits may be updated as more objects are added to the collection and more of our faculty, staff and students contribute their effort to providing access to these materials.</p>
